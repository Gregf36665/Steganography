First ideas
=============

I plan to use an 8-bit picture meaning that the picutre uses 8 bits per color.  
I would set up the bits in an arbatary form; from high to low:
RGBA:
(255,255,255,0)
(11111111,11111111,11111111,00000000)

In this form 2 = 00000010 rather than 01000000

According to my research a change in one bit for each channel would be unnoticable by a human eye.
This means that I can hide at most, a picture an eighth of the size of the 'cover' photo.
This is from the fact that for every byte of the cover picture I can only change one bit.
