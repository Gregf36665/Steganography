Steganography
=============

ES101-06 project 2013-10-30
===========================

This is a freshman engineering project in which I am attempting to build a program capable of hiding pictures and audio in another picture, and also another program capable of decoding my images.

As of 2013-11-04 the picture hiding program is fully operational.

On 2013-11-06 I started working on the audio hiding.
